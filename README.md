# Simple Interest Calculator

## Overview
This repository contains a simple interest calculator script, hosted on GitHub as part of a micro-finance startup's transition from Subversion (SVN) to Git. The startup's mission is to empower and provide opportunities for low-income individuals. This repository is the first step in adopting best practices for open-source collaboration.

## Features
- Calculates simple interest based on principal, rate, and time.
- Hosted on GitHub following best version control practices.
- Open-source under the Apache License 2.0.
- Includes a **Code of Conduct** and **Contribution Guidelines** to encourage community involvement.

## Installation
To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-interest-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd simple-interest-calculator
   ```
3. Run the script (depending on the language used):
   ```bash
   python simple_interest.py  # If using Python
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   node simple_interest.js  # If using JavaScript
   ```

## Usage
This calculator computes simple interest given the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

### Input:
- **p**: Principal amount
- **t**: Time period in years
- **r**: Annual rate of interest

### Output:
- **Simple Interest** = (p × t × r) / 100

Modify the script to input your own values and get the calculated simple interest.
